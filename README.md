# Virtual Cookbook
A functioning virtual cookbook that combines my love for cooking and coding. This project was created for the Odin Project and demostrates my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. Turnjs is used for the flipbook animation.

Features:
Can use arrow keys to turn pages.
Can skip to different sections/recipes in the Table of Contents.
